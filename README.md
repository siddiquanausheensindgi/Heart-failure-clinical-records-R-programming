# Heart failure clinical records in -R-programming
  R Programming Project


This dataset contains the medical records of 299 patients who had heart failure, collected during their follow-up period, where each patient profile has 13 clinical features. Death Event is the target variable. Based on the clinical features, we can predict the death event variable of the patient. It is a categorical variable(Classification).

The dataset is taken from UCI Machine Learning Repository.

Code book of the variables: There are 13 clinical features - age: age of the patient (years) - anaemia: decrease of red blood cells or hemoglobin (boolean) - high blood pressure: if the patient has hypertension (boolean) - creatinine phosphokinase (CPK): level of the CPK enzyme in the blood (mcg/L) - diabetes: if the patient has diabetes (boolean) - ejection fraction: percentage of blood leaving the heart at each contraction (percentage) - platelets: platelets in the blood (kiloplatelets/mL) - sex: woman or man (binary) - serum creatinine: level of serum creatinine in the blood (mg/dL) - serum sodium: level of serum sodium in the blood (mEq/L) - smoking: if the patient smokes or not (boolean) - time: follow-up period (days) - [target] death event: if the patient deceased during the follow-up period (boolean)
The Target Variable is the DEATH EVENT variable which is categorical and its a binary classification(0 and 1)
